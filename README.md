### Overview

`goldi` is a tool for identifying key terms in text. It has been developed with the intention of identifying ontological labels in free form text with specific application to finding [Gene Ontology](http://geneontology.org) terms in the biomedical literature with strict canonical NLP quality control.

### Installation

`goldi` can be installed from CRAN with

```R
install.packages("goldi")
```

Or, you may choose to install the latest stable development version with

```R
devtools::install_github("Chris1221/goldi")
```

### Minimal Example

`goldi` attempts to identify terms in free text through semantic similarity. This means that if a term and a sentence share a high number of words, the sentence has a higher probability of talking about the term.

Given the following input text and the included pre-computed term document matrix for approximately 10,000 Gene Onotlogy molecular function terms, we can find which are discussed in our text.

```R
# Give the free form text
doc <- "In this sentence we will talk about ribosomal chaperone activity. In this sentence we will talk about nothing. Here we discuss obsolete molecular terms."

# Load in the included term document matrix for the terms
data("TDM.go.df")

# Pipe output and log to /dev/null
output = "/dev/null"
log = "/dev/null"

# Run the function
goldi(doc = doc, 
  term_tdm = TDM.go.df,
  output = output,
  log = log,
  object = TRUE)
```

Note in the above example, we impliment a few other options. Firstly, we don't want to see the output or the log for this example, so we pipe them to `/dev/null`. Secondly, we would like to return the output as an R object instead of writing it to a file, so we specify `object = TRUE`. 

This will output the following table:

|          Term                |                               Context                            |
| ---------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------  |
| ribosomal_chaperone_activity | In this sentence we will talk about ribosomal chaperone activity |

This will give the term identified and the context in the free form where it was identified. This table will form the basis for all further analysis.

### FAQ

Q: **This is all really confusing, where can I read more about this package?**
> A: Please see the pre print of our paper.

Q: **How does `goldi` match terms to sentences?**
> A: `goldi` accomplishes this by finding the number of similar words in a term and in a sentence, comparing this to a user defined acceptance function A(n) based on the length of the term n. The default function is given by the following: <p align = "center"> ![A](http://www.sciweavers.org/tex2img.php?eq=%5Cmathcal%7BA%7D%28n%29%20%3D%20%5Cbegin%7Bcases%7D%20n%20%26%20n%20%5Cleq%203%20%5C%5C%20n-1%20%26%204%20%5Cleq%20n%20%5Cleq%207%20%5C%5C%20n-2%20%26%208%20%5Cleq%20n%20%5Cleq%2010%20%5C%5C%20n-3%20%26%20n%20%3E%2010%20%5Cend%7Bcases%7D&bc=White&fc=Black&im=jpg&fs=12&ff=mathdesign&edit=0) <p> This may be represented as a vector in R `lims <- c(1,2,3,3,4,5,6,6,7,8,9)` If the number of words present equals or exceeds this function, then a match is declared. You are encouraged to play around and find what acceptance function works for you.

Q: **What if I don't have my text in R, but instead as a text or PDF file?**
> A: `goldi` has four distinct methods for importing text locally, please see the wiki article on the subject.

Q: **When I install the package, I get messages about `libc` or `gcc` versions. What's happening?**
> A: The most likely scenario is that your `gcc` compiler (which compiles the `c++` code) is out of date, espcially if you are on an older version of linux distribution like CentOS on some cluster systems. Contact your system administrator and try to update `gcc`.

Q: **How can I work with abstracts from pubmed?**
> A: We recommend the `RISmed` package.

Q: **Where can I see some examples of this package in use?**
> A: Please see the included vignettes, especially the overexpression analysis implimented in the paper.

Q: **I am looking for a project to work on with `goldi`, do you have any ideas?**
> A: Please see [here](https://github.com/Chris1221/goldi/blob/master/project_ideas.md).

Q: **Nothing is working, who can I complain to?**
> A: Please raise an issue on this repository, that's most likely to get answered.
